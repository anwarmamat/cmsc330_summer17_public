# Project 2B: OCaml Higher Order Functions and Data
CMSC330, Summer 2017  
Due June 18, 2017

Ground Rules and Extra Info
---------------------------
This is **NOT** a pair project. You must work on this project alone as with most other CS projects. See the Academic Integrity section for more information.

In your code, you may only use library functions found in the [`Pervasives` module][pervasives doc] and the functions provided in `funs.ml`. You may not use any imperative structures of OCaml such as references.

At a few points in this document, it will be requested that you raise an `Invalid_argument` exception. To raise an exception in OCaml, use the function `raise : exn -> 'a`. The argument `exn` is the exception to raise, and `Invalid_argument` is part of the `exn` data type. The return value is `'a` in order to match to surrounding branch types and can therefore be ignored. In order to raise an `Invalid_argument` exception with the message, "something went wrong", the following line of code would suffice:
```
raise (Invalid_argument("something went wrong"))
```

Introduction
------------
The goal of this project is to increase your familiarity with programming in OCaml using higher order functions and user-defined types. You will have to write a total of 15 small functions, the specifications of which are given below. Some of them start out as code we provide you. In our reference solution, each function typically requires writing or modifying 5-8 lines of code, except for the last function, `reachable`, which is more involved.

**This project is due in one week!** We recommend you get started right away, going from top to bottom. The problems get increasingly more challenging, and in many cases later problems can take advantage of earlier solutions.

Project Files
-------------
To begin this project, you will need to commit any uncommitted changes to your local branch and pull updates from the git repository. [Click here for directions on working with the Git repository.][git instructions] The following are the relevant files:

<!-- TODO add the real files to the document and ensure that they're correct -->
-  OCaml Files
  - **data.ml**: This is where you will write your code for all parts of the project. All other files will be discarded.
  - **data.mli**: This file is used to describe the signature of all the functions in the module. Don't worry about this file, but make sure it exists or your code will not compile. It also contains our type definitions.
  - **funs.ml** and **funs.mli**: These files contain definitions for map, fold, length, and reverse.
  - **public.ml**: This file contains all of the public test cases.
- Submission Scripts and Other Files
  - **submit.rb**: Execute this script to submit your project to the submit server.
  - **submit.jar** and **.submit**: Don't worry about these files, but make sure you have them.
  - **Makefile**: This is used to build the public tests by simply running the command `make`, just as in 216.

Compilation and Tests
---------------------
In order to compile your project, simply run the `make` command and our `Makefile` will handle the compilation process for you, just as in 216. After compiling your code, the public tests can be run by running `public.native` (i.e. `./public.native`; think of this just like with a.out in C)

Part 1: High Order Functions
------------------------
Write the following functions using `map`, `fold`, or `fold_right` as defined in the file `funs.ml`.

#### count e lst
- **Type**: `'a -> 'a list -> int`
- **Description**: Returns how many times the element `e` occurs in `lst`.
- **Examples:**
```
count 3 [1;3;1;1;3] = 2
count "hello" ["there";"ralph"] = 0
```

#### divisible_by n lst
- **Type**: `int -> int list -> bool list`
- **Description**: Returns a list of booleans where each boolean represents if the corresponding element of `lst` is divisible by `n`. Take note that 0 is divisible by 0.
- **Examples:**
```
divisible_by 2 [1;3;4;8;0] = [false;false;true;true;true]
```

#### divisible_by_first lst
- **Type**: `int list -> bool list`
- **Description**: Returns a list of booleans where each boolean represents if the corresponding element of `lst` is divisible by the first element of `lst`. Take note that 0 is divisible by 0.
- **Examples:**
```
divisible_by_first [2;3;4;8;0] = [true;false;true;true;true]
divisible_by_first [2] = [true]
divisible_by_first [] = []
```

#### pairup lst1 lst2
- **Type**: `'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b) list`
- **Description**: Returns a list of tuples containing every possible combination of elements from `lst1` and `lst2` and nothing more.
- **Examples:**
```
pairup [] [] = []
pairup [1;2] [3;4;5] = [(1, 3); (1, 4); (1, 5); (2, 3); (2, 4); (2, 5)]
```

#### concat_lists lst
- **Type**: `'a list list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns a list consisting of the elements of `lst` concatenated together. Note that only the top level of lists is concatenated, whereas List.flatten concatenates all levels.
- **Examples:**
```
concat_lists [[1;2];[7];[5;4;3]] = [1;2;7;5;4;3]
concat_lists [[[1;2;3];[2]];[[7]]] = [[1;2;3];[2];[7]]
```

Part 2: Integer BST
--------------------------------
You will write functions that will operate on a binary search tree whose nodes contain integers. Provided below is the type of `int_tree`.

```
type int_tree =
    IntLeaf
  | IntNode of int * int_tree * int_tree
```

According to this definition, an ``int_tree`` is either: empty (just a leaf), or a node (containing an integer, left subtree, and right subtree). An empty tree is just a leaf.

```
let empty_int_tree = IntLeaf
```

Like lists, BSTs are immutable. Once created we cannot change it. To insert an element into a tree, create a new tree that is the same as the old, but with the new element added. Let's write `insert` for our `int_tree`. Recall the algorithm for inserting element `x` into a tree:

- *Empty tree?* Return a single-node tree.
- `x` *less than the current node?* Return a tree that has the same content as the present tree but where the left subtree is instead the tree that results from inserting `x` into the original left subtree.
- `x` *already in the tree?* Return the tree unchanged.
- `x` *greater than the current node?* Return a tree that has the same content as the present tree but where the right subtree is instead the tree that results from inserting `x` into the original right subtree.

Here's one implementation:

```
let rec int_insert x t =
  match t with
    IntLeaf -> IntNode (x, IntLeaf, IntLeaf)
  | IntNode (y, l, r) when x < y -> IntNode (y, int_insert x l, r)
  | IntNode (y, l, r) when x = y -> t
  | IntNode (y, l, r) -> IntNode (y, l, int_insert x r)
```

**Note**: The `when` syntax may be unfamiliar to you - it acts as an extra guard in addition to the pattern. For example, `IntNode (y, l, r) when x < y` will only be matched when the tree is an `IntNode` and `x < y`. This serves a similar purpose to having an if statement inside of the general `IntNode` match case, but allows for more readable syntax in many cases.

Let's try writing a function which determines whether a tree contains an element. This follows a similar procedure except we'll be returning a boolean if the element is a member of the tree.

```
let rec int_mem x t =
  match t with
    IntLeaf -> false
  | IntNode (y, l, r) when x < y -> int_mem x l
  | IntNode (y, l, r) when x = y -> true
  | IntNode (y, l, r) -> int_mem x r
```

It's your turn now! Write the following functions which operate on `int_tree`.

#### int_size t
- **Type**: `int_tree -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the number of nodes in tree `t`.
- **Examples:**
```
int_size empty_int_tree = 0
int_size (int_insert 1 (int_insert 2 empty_int_tree)) = 2
```

#### int_max t
- **Type**: `int_tree -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the maximum element in tree `t`. Raises exception `Invalid_argument("int_max")` on an empty tree. This function should be O(height of the tree).
- **Examples:**
```
int_max (int_insert_all [1;2;3] empty_int_tree) = 3
```

#### int_insert_all lst t
- **Type**: `int list -> int_tree -> int_tree`
- **Description**: Returns a tree which is the same as tree `t`, but with all the integers in list `lst` added to it. Try to use fold to implement this in one line.
- **Examples:**
```
int_as_list (int_insert_all [1;2;3] empty_int_tree) = [1;2;3]
```

#### int_as_list t
- **Type**: `int_tree -> int list`
- **Description**: Returns a list where the values correspond to an [in-order traversal][wikipedia inorder traversal] on tree `t`.
- **Examples:**
```
int_as_list (int_insert 2 (int_insert 1 empty_int_tree)) = [1;2]
int_as_list (int_insert 2 (int_insert 2 (int_insert 3 empty_int_tree))) = [2;3]
```

#### int_common t x y
- **Type**: `int_tree -> int -> int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the closest common ancestor of `x` and `y` in the tree `t` (i.e. the lowest shared parent in the tree). Raises exception `Invalid_argument("int_common")` on an empty tree or where `x` or `y` don't exist in tree `t`.
- **Examples:**
```
let t = int_insert_all [6;1;8;5;10;13;9;4] empty_int_tree;;
int_common t 1 10 = 6
int_common t 8 9 = 8
```

Part 3: Polymorphic BST
---------------------------------
Our type `int_tree` is limited to integer elements. We want to define a binary search tree over *any* totally ordered type. Let's define the type `'a atree` to do so.

```
type 'a atree =
    Leaf
  | Node of 'a * 'a atree * 'a atree
```

This defintion is the same as `int_tree` except it's polymorphic. The nodes may contain any type `'a`, not just integers. Since a tree may contain any value, we need a way to compare values. We define a type for comparison functions.

```
type 'a compfn = 'a -> 'a -> int
```

Any comparison function will take two `'a` values and return an integer. If the integer is negative, the first value is less than the second; if positive, the first value is greater; if 0 they're equal.

Finally, we can bundle the two previous types to create a polymorphic BST.

```
type 'a ptree = 'a compfn * 'a atree
```

An empty tree is just a leaf and some comparison function.

```
let empty_ptree f : 'a ptree = (f, Leaf)
```

You can modify the code from your `int_tree` functions to implement some functions on `ptree`. Remember to use the bundled comparison function!

#### pinsert x t
- **Type**: `'a -> 'a ptree -> 'a ptree`
- **Description**: Returns a tree which is the same as tree `t`, but with `x` added to it.
- **Examples:**
```
let int_comp x y = if x < y then -1 else if x > y then 1 else 0;;
let t0 = empty_ptree int_comp;;
let t1 = pinsert 1 (pinsert 8 (pinsert 5 t0));;
```

#### pmem x t
- **Type**: `'a -> 'a ptree -> bool`
- **Description**: Returns true iff `x` is an element of tree `t`.
- **Examples:**
```
(* see definitions of t0 and t1 above *)
pmem 5 t0 = false
pmem 5 t1 = true
pmem 1 t1 = true
pmem 2 t1 = false
```

Part 4: Graphs with Records
--------------------------------------
For the last part of this project, you will implement functions which operate on graphs.

Here are the types for graphs. They use OCaml's record syntax.

```
type node = int
type edge = { src: node; dst: node; }
type graph = { nodes: int_tree; edges: edge list }
```

A graph is record with two fields: a set of nodes aptly called "nodes" (represented as an `int_tree`), and a list of edges. A node is represented as an integer, and an edge is a record identifying its source and destination nodes.

An empty graph has no nodes (i.e., the empty integer tree) and has no edges (the empty list).

```
let empty_graph = { nodes = empty_int_tree; edges = [] }
```

Provided below is a function which adds an edge to a graph. Its type is `edge -> graph -> graph`.

```
let add_edge e { nodes = ns; edges = es } =
  let { src = s; dst = d } = e in
  let ns' = int_insert s ns in
  let ns'' = int_insert d ns' in
  let es' = e::es in
  { nodes = ns''; edges = es' }
```

Given an edge `e` and graph `g`, it returns a new graph that is the same as `g`, but with `e` added. Note this routine makes no attempt to eliminate duplicate edges; these could add some inefficiency, but should not harm correctness.

We also provide a function `add_edges : edge list -> graph -> graph` to add multiple edges at once.

Write the following functions which operate on `graph`.

#### graph_empty g
- **Type**: `graph -> bool`
- **Description**: Returns true iff graph `g` is empty.
- **Examples:**
```
graph_empty (add_edge { src = 1; dst = 2 } empty_graph) = false
graph_empty empty_graph = true
```

#### graph_size g
- **Type**: `graph -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the number of nodes in graph `g`.
- **Examples:**
```
graph_size (add_edge { src = 1; dst = 2 } empty_graph) = 2
graph_size (add_edge { src = 1; dst = 1 } empty_graph) = 1
```

#### is_dst n e
- **Type**: `node -> edge -> bool`
- **Description**: Returns true iff node `n` is the destination of edge `e`.
- **Examples:**
```
is_dst 1 { src = 1; dst = 2 } = false
is_dst 2 { src = 1; dst = 2 } = true
```

#### src_edges n g
- **Type**: `node -> graph -> edge list`
- **Description**: Returns a list of edges in graph `g` whose source node is `n`.
- **Examples:**
```
src_edges 1 (add_edges [{src=1;dst=2}; {src=1;dst=3}; {src=2;dst=2}] empty_graph) = [{src=1;dst=2}; {src=1;dst=3}]
```

#### reachable n g
- **Type**: `node -> graph -> int_tree`
- **Description**: Returns the set of nodes reachable from node `n` in graph `g`, where the set is represented as an `int_tree`. If `n` is neither a source nor a destination in the graph, `IntLeaf` should be returned.
- **Examples:**
```
int_as_list
 (reachable 1
   (add_edges [{src=1;dst=2}; {src=1;dst=3}; {src=2;dst=2}] empty_graph)) =
   [1;2;3]

int_as_list
 (reachable 3
   (add_edges [{src=1;dst=2}; {src=1;dst=3}; {src=2;dst=2}] empty_graph)) =
   [3]

int_as_list
 (reachable 2
   (add_edges [{src=0;dst=1}] empty_graph)) =
   []
```

Project Submission
------------------
You should submit a file `data.ml` containing your solution. You may submit other files, but they will be ignored during grading. We will run your solution as individual OUnit tests just as in the provided public test file.

Be sure to follow the project description exactly! Your solution will be graded automatically, so any deviation from the specification will result in lost points.

You can submit your project in two ways:
- Submit your `data.ml` file directly to the [submit server][submit server] by clicking on the submit link in the column "web submission".
![Where to find the web submission link][web submit link]  
Then, use the submit dialog to submit your `data.ml` file directly.
![Where to upload the file][web upload example]  
Select your file using the "Browse" button, then press the "Submit project!" button. You **do not** need to put it in a zip file.
- Submit directly by executing a the submission script on a computer with Java and network access. Included in this project are the submission scripts and related files listed under **Project Files**. These files should be in the directory containing your project. From there you can either execute submit.rb or run the command `java -jar submit.jar` directly (this is all submit.rb does).

No matter how you choose to submit your project, make sure that your submission is received by checking the [submit server][submit server] after submitting.
